# monkey-lang-interpreter
An interpreter for the Monkey programming language.

I am currently reading "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball, where the author implements 
an interpreter for a toy language they have designed, called "Monkey". This is my implementation of 
that interpreter, written in Haskell. 

I chose Haskell because I am told that functional languages are well suited for writing interpreters and
compilers, and I've been wanting to put more time into picking up the basics of the language.
